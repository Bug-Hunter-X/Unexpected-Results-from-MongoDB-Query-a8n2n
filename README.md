# Unexpected MongoDB Query Results

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when querying MongoDB databases: unexpected results or errors stemming from incorrect query construction or projection. The provided JavaScript code attempts to retrieve a limited set of user data based on age, but the query might be flawed, leading to incorrect or incomplete output.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, and the `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with explanations of the potential issues and how to resolve them.

## Potential Causes

* **Incorrect Query Parameters:**  Ensure that the query operators (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, etc.) and conditions are accurately applied based on your database schema.
* **Projection Errors:** Verify that the projection (`{ _id: 0, name: 1, email: 1 }`) correctly selects the desired fields. An incorrect projection can result in missing data or unwanted fields.
* **Data Type Mismatches:** Confirm that the data types in your query and in your MongoDB collection match. Type mismatches can lead to unexpected results.
* **Missing Indexes:** If you're querying large datasets, consider creating indexes on the fields used in your query to improve performance and avoid unexpected behavior due to slow query execution.

## Resolution

The solution typically involves carefully reviewing the query, projection, data types, and indexes to ensure they are correct and optimized for the specific task.
